    <h2>Description</h2>
    <pIn cuisine, an omelette (also spelled omelet) is a dish made from beaten eggs, fried with butter or oil in a frying pan. <br>
    It is quite common for the omelette to be folded around fillings such as chives, vegetables, mushrooms, meat (often ham or bacon), <br>
    cheese, onions or some combination of the above. Whole eggs or egg whites are often beaten with a small amount of milk, cream, or water.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons grated cheese, any kind</li>
      <li>3 to 4 cherry tomatoes, cut in half and sprinkled lightly with salt</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped basil, parsley, or herb of your choice</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a fork.</li>
      <li>In an 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium-low heat, melt the butter.</li>
      <li>Add the eggs to the skillet and cook without stirring until the edges begin to set. With a silicone spatula, <br>
          push the edges toward the center of the pan and tilt the pan so the uncooked eggs move to the edge.</li>
      <li>Repeat until the eggs are somewhat set but still a little soft in the center, about 6 minutes.</li>
      <li>Place the cheese, tomatoes, and herbs in a line down the center of the omelette <br> 
          and cook for about 1 minute longer, or until the eggs are mostly set but still a little soft in the center.</li>
      <li>Slide the spatula around one side of the omelette at the edge to loosen it. <br>
          Slip it under the eggs, and use it to carefully fold the omelette in half. <br>
          Slide the spatula under the folded omelette to loosen it from the pan. <br>
          Tilt the pan over a plate and use the spatula to nudge it onto the plate. Voila!</li>
    </ol>
