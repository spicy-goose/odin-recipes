    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>When it comes to iconic breakfast and brunch dishes, pancakes are right up there at the top of the list. <br>
      Nothing beats a fluffy, golden stack of homemade pancakes piled high, drenched in a waterfall of maple syrup.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp + 1 tsp baking powder</li>
      <li>1/4 cup sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp baking soda</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/4 cup Canola oil</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups half & half</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Whisk all your dry ingredients together in a bowl (flour, baking powder, sugar, baking soda, salt).</li>
      <li>Next, whisk all your wet ingredients together (eggs, oil, half & half, vanilla extract).</li>
      <li>Add your wet ingredients to the dry ingredients, but don’t over-mix the batter—you want a light and fluffy batter. <br>
          About 12-14 turns. Cover and rest your batter for 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat your griddle to 350 degrees F, then oil the griddle. Use a scooper or a 1/4 cup to add your pancake batter to the griddle,<br> 
          spreading out 4 inches apart. You can fit 6 pancakes on a griddle at once.</li>
      <li>Once you see bubbles forming on the top of the pancakes and the edges turning brown, flip each pancake over.<br> 
          They should be soft in the middle and golden on the top.</li>
      <li>If you’re adding ingredients to your pancakes (like blueberries, chocolate chips or sausage, add them to the batter before flipping).</li>
      <li>Keep pancakes warm in an oven set to 200 degrees F.</li>
    </ol>
